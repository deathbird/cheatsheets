https://clementc.github.io/blog/2018/01/25/moving_cli/

CTRL + A : goto start of line  
CTRL + E : goto end of line  
CTRL + L : clear screen above current line 
CTRL + R : search command history recursively  
Ctrl + o   Execute the command found via Ctrl+r or Ctrl+s  
Ctrl + g   Escape from history searching mode  
Ctrl + U : cut from cursor to START of line also clearing all the line if you are at line end  
Ctrl + W : cut from cursor to START of word also clearing all the line if you are at line end  
Ctrl + K : cut from cursor to END of line also clearing all the line if you are at line start  
Ctrl + Y : paste  

Use !! to prefix to the last command:  
sudo !!  

!:n selects ONLY the nth argument of the last command  
!$ selects the last argument of the last command. 

## sudo vs su

1. sudo runs a command as the root user
2. su <username> opens a shell impersonating <username>.  
`su <username> -c "command to execute"  # to execute a command`  
In Ubuntu root user has no password so there is a difficulty to run su as root user ...


gksu / gksudo : Run a graphical command as root / another user  
`$ gksu nautilus`

## dpkg  

Packages are manually installed via the dpkg command (Debian Package Management System). dpkg is the backend to commands like apt-get and aptitude, which in turn are the backend for GUI install apps like the Software Center and Synaptic.

```bash
# Install a package
sudo dpkg -i {package_name}

# Remove a package
sudo dpkg -r {package_name}
sudo dpkg -r vlc
# Remove a package and its configuration files
sudo dpkg -P {package_name}

# Check if the package is installed or not
dpkg -l {package_name}
dpkg -l vlc
# See whether a package is installed or not
# And this will show the location where the package will be installed. Here -S (capital S) to search whether the package was installed or not.

sudo dpkg -S skype
``` 

## apt-get

sudo apt-cache search php7-*    # find the name of a package from repos  

sudo apt-get install php7.1-mbstring
