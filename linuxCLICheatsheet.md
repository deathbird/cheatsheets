# Linux / Bash CLI Cheatsheet 

** You should use "double quotes" for any argument that contains expansions (such as $variable or $(command) expansions) 
and 'single quotes' for any other arguments. Single quotes make sure that everything in the quotes remains literal. **

## BASH keyboard shortcuts

https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-keyboard.html 
https://clementc.github.io/blog/2018/01/25/moving_cli/

Ctrl + D : exit
CTRL + A : goto start of line  
CTRL + E : goto end of line  
CTRL + L : clear screen above current line 
CTRL + R : search command history recursively  
Ctrl + o   Execute the command found via Ctrl+r or Ctrl+s  
Ctrl + g   Escape from history searching mode  
Ctrl + U : cut from cursor to START of line also clearing all the line if you are at line end  
Ctrl + W : cut from cursor to START of word also clearing all the line if you are at line end  
Ctrl + K : cut from cursor to END of line also clearing all the line if you are at line start  
Ctrl + Y : paste  

Use !! to prefix to the last command:  
sudo !!  

!:n selects ONLY the nth argument of the last command  
!$ selects the last argument of the last command. 

## Various BASH useful
```bash
# last boot time:
who -a

# where bash finds the program to run for a command name, the -a switch shows all posibilities
$ type -a echo
echo is a shell builtin
echo is /bin/echo

# set environment variable
$ PATH=$PATH:~/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin

# set environment variable permanently for user by editing ~/.profile file, for example last line:
# set PATH so it includes user's private bin directories
PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH:/opt/PhpStorm-183.4886.46/bin"

# show environment variable
echo "$PATH"

#You should use "double quotes" for any argument that contains expansions (such as $variable or $(command) expansions) 
# and 'single quotes' for any other arguments. Single quotes make sure that everything in the quotes remains literal.
```  

## sudo vs su

1. sudo runs a command as the root user
2. su <username> opens a shell impersonating <username>.  
`su <username> -c "command to execute"  # to execute a command`  
In Ubuntu root user has no password so there is a difficulty to run su as root user ...


gksu / gksudo : Run a graphical command as root / another user  
`$ gksu nautilus`

## dpkg  

Packages are manually installed via the dpkg command (Debian Package Management System). dpkg is the backend to commands like apt-get and aptitude, which in turn are the backend for GUI install apps like the Software Center and Synaptic.

https://askubuntu.com/questions/40779/how-do-i-install-a-deb-file-via-the-command-line

```bash
# Install a package
sudo dpkg -i {package_name}    
sudo dpkg -i skype-ubuntu-precise_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb
# Remove a package
sudo dpkg -r {package_name}
sudo dpkg -r vlc
# Remove a package and its configuration files
sudo dpkg -P {package_name}
sudo dpkg -P vlc
# List all installed packages.
# You can pipe the command Î» less (a pager) so you can more easily scroll the content:
dpkg -l | less
# Check if the package is installed or not
dpkg -l {package_name}
dpkg -l vlc
# See whether a package is installed or not
# And this will show the location where the package will be installed. Here -S (capital S) to search whether the package was installed or not.
sudo dpkg -S {package_name}
sudo dpkg -S skype
``` 

## apt-get  
```bash
sudo apt list --installed | grep php   # list installed php packages 

sudo apt-cache search php7-*    # find the name of a package from repos  

sudo apt-get install php7.1-mbstring 

# SSH install in Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server 
sudo service ssh status

# completely uninstall (application + system configuration files) an application
$ sudo apt purge gitkraken 
```

## yum (CentOS package manager) 
```bash
# check if app is installed (centos)
yum list installed httpd
yum list installed mysql-server

# check if apache is installed alternative (centos)
rpm -qa | grep httpd
```

## files (find, compare, zip...)
**Everything is a file: even a device (monitor, printer), a directory etc.**  
```bash
# list only hidden files  
$ ls -ld .?*  

# unzip *.tar.gz  
$ tar -xzf file1.tar.gz  

# unzip *.gz  
$ gunzip file1.gz  

# Display file or file system status, timestamps (Access, Modify, Change)  
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2464/timestamp-modification-time-and-created-time-of-a-file  
$ stat <filename>  

# Locate the binary file  
$ which apache2  

# Locate the binary, source, and manual-page files for a command  
$ whereis apache2  

# Show all possibilities of a command  
$type -a echo  
echo is a shell builtin  
echo is /bin/echo  

# compare files / folders:  
# -r : recursive, -q : short syntax, -l : paginate  
diff -rql  nlo-toto/Public/static/cms/ CanvasDocker/Public/static/cms/  

# will show if two binary files are the same or not:  
[me@host ~]$ diff 1.bin 2.bin
Binary files 1.bin and 2.bin differ
# If there is no output from the command, it means that the files have no differences.  
```  

## Get Help
```bash
man <term> # term can be a bash command, a config file ( or daemon (ex. apache2)

# search for command in manual pages
man -k <search-term>
apropos <search-term>

# GLOBAL search for command in manual pages
man -K <search-term>

# find info for files. Linux is extensionless (extension dont mean a thing).
file <filename>

# description of manual page
$ whatis apache2

# Locate the binary, source, and manual-page files for a command
$ whereis apache2

# man sections to open as: man <section> <file>
       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

# for example passwd is a command and a file (*.gz are man pages)
$ whereis passwd  
passwd: /usr/bin/passwd /etc/passwd /usr/share/man/man5/passwd.5.gz /usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1ssl.gz /usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1.gz
$ man passwd     # opens the first manual found
$ man 5 passwd   # opens a page from section 5 -> man <section> <file>

# Other ways to do services management:

	sudo /etc/init.d/apache stop

	sudo service httpd start
	sudo service mysqld start
	sudo service mysqld restart
	sudo service memcached restart && service session_cache restart
	
	sudo service mysql status
	sudo service mysql start

       # set service to autostart
	sudo chkconfig httpd on	     
	sudo chkconfig mysqld on 

       # list autostart services
	sudo chkconfig --list | grep mysqld  

# services running check:
	
	service httpd status
	service apache2 status
	service mysql status
	ps aux | grep apache
        # check all running servers on machine!!!
	sudo netstat -tulpen 
       
# task management:

	top

		# press k (kill) PID (enter twice)
		# press h (help)

# kill process by pid:

	ps aux | grep java	# find process by name. Alternatively use : pidof java
	kill -SIGTERM <pid>	# kill sending termination signal to the process (the safest way).
        kill -9 <pid>           # if above kill and anything else fails!!!

## Directories
```bash
# delete non empty directory:
rm -rf <dir_name>

# copy folder recursively, verbose, with all attributes:
cp -avr ./leaderboard /home/vagrant/

# zip folder and subfolders:
zip -r zip_filename.zip /path/to/folder


# show tree directory structure (install tree utility -> sudo apt install tree)
tree -d .

# Back to home dir:
cd
```  

## Free disk space
```bash
# -h : human readable (1M = 1024Kb etc)
df -h

# find folder size (du summarizes disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories,)
du -hs /path/to/directory
```


## Disks - partitions
```bash  
# friendly listing
$ sudo lsblk -f

# device <-> mount point mapping !!!!
$ df -h --output=source,target

# alternative, not so human friendly
$ sudo fdisk -l

# list mounted filesystems
$ findmnt

# list all mounts
$ cat /proc/mounts
$ cat /proc/mounts | grep ext4  # or grep vfat (to display usb drives)
```  

## Network
```bash
# show used ports
sudo lsof -i

# show processes using specific port
sudo lsof -i :3306

# get binary script from PID from lsof listing:
COMMAND     PID USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
firefox   22745  jdi   50u  IPv4 2778942      0t0  TCP 10.70.30.223:38378->40.100.174.2:https (ESTABLISHED)

$ls -l /proc/22745/exe
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jdi jdi 0 ÎÎ¿Î­   3 09:55 /proc/22745/exe -> /usr/lib/firefox/firefox

$ whatis firefox
firefox (1)          - a free and open source web browser from Mozilla

# report working directory of a process PID
$pwdx 22745
```


## Redirections
```bash
$ ls -l a b >myfiles.ls 2>/dev/null

# Redirections: Make FD2 write to where FD1 is writing (FD copying: The connection to the stream used by FD y is copied to FD x.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ls -l a b >myfiles.ls 2>&1            # CORRECT! Redirecting standard output and standard error.
$ ls -l a b &>myfiles.ls		# CORRECT! Shortcut of the above. 
$ ls -l a b >myfiles.ls 2>myfiles.ls    # WRONG! WRONG! The streams end up mixed in the output file!!!! Use the above way.
$ ls -l a b 2>&1 >myfiles.ls		# ALSO WRONG! Copy FD2 to FD1 but FD1 hasn't been redirected (to file) yet so it is still the terminal output.

# File redirection: Make FD x write to / read from file.
---------------------------------------------------------
$ echo Hello >~/world	# Default FD for writing is FD 1.
$ rm file 2>/dev/null
$ read line <file	# Default FD for reading is FD 0.

# Appending file redirection
$ echo World >>~/world	# Append also FD1 to file.
$ echo World &>>~/world	# Append also FD2 (error) to file.

# copy to clipboard (install xclip command first):
$ xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   # copy contents of private key file to clipboard
$ php -i | xclip -selection clipboard              # send/pipe command output to clipboard!!
$ xclip -selection clipboard - o                   # paste to std output clipboard contents!!
